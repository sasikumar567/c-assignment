This program will compile and execute without errors in C, but it will result in a compilation error in C++.

In C, the keyword "new" is not a reserved keyword, so it can be used as a variable name. Therefore, the program will create a variable named "new" with the value of 5 and then print its value using the printf function. The output of the program will be "5".

However, in C++, the keyword "new" is a reserved keyword that is used for dynamic memory allocation. Therefore, when the compiler encounters the line "int new = 5;", it will generate a compilation error because "new" is not a valid variable name in C++. To fix the error, the variable name should be changed to something else, such as "newVar"
