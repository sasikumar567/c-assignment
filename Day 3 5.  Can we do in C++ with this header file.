#include<bits/stdc++.h>
 
intmain ()
{
   inta = 15, b = 20;
   printf("max = %d\n", ((a + b) + abs(a - b)) / 2);
   printf("min = %d", ((a + b) - abs(a - b)) / 2);
   return0;
}

Answer:
The code you provided finds the maximum and minimum of two numbers. The header file bits/stdc++.h includes all standard libraries in C++. However, it is not recommended to use this header file in competitive programming as it increases compilation time and is not portable across different compilers1.
